# Welcome to my Theme Repo
I call this a theme repository, but you could also describe it as a plugin repository.

# What you'll need <br>
You will need an extension that allows you to save and run custom JavaScript and CSS on any website
I am working on my own extension to use my themes/plugins, but for now you'll have to settle with 3rd party tools.

What I am using: <br>
Javascript: [Custom JavaScript for websites by hromada.dan](https://www.google.com "Visit extension in store") <br>
CSS: [Stylus by stylus.openstyles](https://add0n.com/stylus.html "Visit official website")
